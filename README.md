Applied Geospatial Computation Lab Project

🎯 Big Picture: Why This Project Matters
The Gulf Coast is a critical hub for the United States' energy sector, facing increasing threats from climate change (e.g., severe storms, sea-level rise) and active geological processes (e.g., land subsidence). Maintaining the stability and resilience of its vast transmission line infrastructure is paramount for national energy security and the region's economy.

This project utilizes cutting-edge InSAR (Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar) data from the NASA/JPL OPERA mission to systematically assess and classify the deformation risk of transmission towers across the Gulf Coast.

The ultimate goal is to produce actionable recommendations for transmission line planning, siting, and maintenance to support the Gulf Coast's growing energy needs and enhance the resilience of the energy grid against environmental hazards.
